# Find Waldo

This was my and Nathan Pham's final project for computer vision. We wanted to make a program that solves find waldo. But we had to use C++ OpenCV and not use any external libraries or cloud computing.

This project was challenging and educative, but the final result is lacking. The problem was simply too hard given the time, technological, and competency constraints.
